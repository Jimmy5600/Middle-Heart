    <p>Fun Fact! Did you know Justin Reid once designed and sold “In Spags We Trust” t-shirts? Which was a playful nod to Chiefs defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo.</p>

    <h3>American Heart Association</h3>
    <p>The American Heart Association (AHA) is a nonprofit organization dedicated to improving cardiovascular health and reducing deaths caused by heart disease and stroke. Founded in 1924 by a group of six pioneering cardiologists, the organization was established at a time when very little was known about heart disease and treatment options were extremely limited. Since then, the AHA has grown into one of the most influential health organizations in the United States, leading efforts in research, public education, and advocacy.

    <br>The primary mission of the American Heart Association is to promote better heart health and to raise awareness about the importance of preventing cardiovascular diseases. Through nationwide campaigns, educational resources, and community programs, the AHA works to educate the public on risk factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, obesity, and physical inactivity. Additionally, the organization actively trains millions of people in lifesaving techniques like CPR, equipping bystanders with the skills necessary to respond during cardiac emergencies.

    <br>According to the American Heart Association, deaths from cardiovascular diseases have decreased by over 50% since the organization’s founding, a testament to the progress made in medical research, public awareness, and healthcare initiatives. The AHA continues to fund groundbreaking research projects and advocates for public health policies that support heart health. Looking to the future, the organization remains committed to improving health outcomes, addressing health inequities, and ensuring that more lives are saved through education, innovation, and community engagement.</p>


    
    <h3>The Team</h3>
    <p>We were a group of five people who collaborated together to help with the JReid Indeed mission. Our specific team was named The Middle Hearts, and from the start, we knew exactly what we wanted for our project. Our target demographic was specificlly middle schoolers who are at the age they need to learn how to perform CPR. Our goal was to script and record a video about performing CPR. We also created this website from scratch to help you know more about us!</p>


    <h3>Full Development Team</h3>
    <p>We were one of six different teams, in which everyone scripted a video with a certain target audience in mind and coded a website for that audience as well. </p>
