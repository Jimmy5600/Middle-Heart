    <h1>AHA</h1>
    <p>The American Heart Association (AHA) is a nonprofit organization dedicated to improving heart health and reducing deaths caused by cardiovascular diseases and stroke. Founded in 1924, the AHA has spent over a century working to raise awareness, fund research, and educate the public about the importance of maintaining a healthy heart. Its mission is to be a relentless force for a world of longer, healthier lives.

Since its founding, the AHA has made significant strides in advancing medical research and promoting life-saving practices. According to the organization, deaths from cardiovascular diseases have been cut in half since 1924, thanks to improvements in early detection, treatment, and public education. The AHA also plays a crucial role in setting health guidelines and providing training in CPR and emergency cardiovascular care to both professionals and everyday people.

Today, the American Heart Association continues its work by advocating for public health policies, funding critical research, and encouraging healthier lifestyles. Their message remains clear: through education, prevention, and timely treatment, countless lives can be saved. The organization remains committed to building a healthier future for all communities, leaving a lasting impact on generations to come.</p>
